Cutting-edge platform designed to streamline financial information processing by aggregating, summarizing, and analyzing the sentiment of news articles. 
This platform leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to deliver concise summaries, categorize news topics, and evaluate market sentiment, offering users a clear and actionable overview of financial news trends.
My colleagues and I participated in an AIthon as members of the "Loop Troop" team.Together, we developed a groundbreaking AI-powered financial news aggregator. This immersive experience proved to be both intellectually stimulating and immensely enjoyable.
