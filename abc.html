                <h3> Large offshore investment  ( Finance )</h3>
                <p>The Reserve Bank of India is scrutinizing large write-offs
                     of overseas investments by several companies, suspecting these might not be
                      genuine business decisions. Concerns arise as some firms may have used the 
                      'overseas direct investment' route to transfer funds abroad, bypassing regulations. 
                      The RBI is ensuring compliance with mandatory audit reports and valuation confirmations
                       to validate the legitimacy of these investments. New overseas investment rules from
                        August 2022 allow automatic write-offs, but recent cases under review are from prior 
                        to 2022. The RBI's vigilance aims to uncover potentially fraudulent fund movements. - <strong> Negative</strong></p>
